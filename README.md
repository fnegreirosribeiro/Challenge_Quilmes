# Challenge_Quilmes
This was a challenge proposed by Quilmes Argentina in August of 2022, in which I participated. I learned a lot, got an excelent feedback and my work was also well received. 

In this challenge, I had to analyze and determine the best clients to get an extension or otorgation of credit in a B2B model. 
Since this challenge was inspired in a real problem solved by the Data Science team of Quilmes in 2021. The dataset was modified, however, as to protect the real clients, but keeping the challenge as close as possible to the real one.

The nmotebook and data are in Spanish.
